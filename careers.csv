Tập đoàn Entetsu là một tập đoàn quy mô lớn ở Nhật Bản với bề dày phát triển gần 80 năm và hơn 10,000 nhân viên ở Nhật Bản với doanh thu khoảng 200 tỷ yên (gấp khoảng 4 lần so với một công ty lớn như FPT). Cho tới thời điểm hiện tại, công ty vẫn đang phát triển ổn định mỗi năm. Lĩnh vực kinh doanh của tập đoàn bao gồm giao thông vận tải, chủ yếu là đường sắt, cửa hàng bách hóa, bất động sản, đại lý xe TOYOTA, v.v… Sứ mệnh của công ty Entetsu Vietnam là làm cuộc sống của mọi người trở nên thuận tiện và sung túc hơn bằng việc hỗ trợ kỹ thuật thông qua “hệ sinh thái kinh tế” của Tập đoàn Entetsu. Công ty con tại Việt Nam hứa hẹn là cơ sở đầu tiên và nền tảng cho chiến dịch mở rộng ra nước ngoài của Tập đoàn Entetsu.    Với một tầm nhìn dài hạn trong tương lai, Tập đoàn Entetsu đặt mục tiêu mở rộng ra nước ngoài với  trọng tâm là châu Á. Do đó, Entetsu Việt Nam hướng tới phát triển nguồn nhân lực trình độ cao không chỉ ở Nhật Bản hay Việt Nam mà còn là nguồn nhân lực từ toàn cầu. Với nền tảng này, chúng tôi đang tìm kiếm những người sẽ trở thành nhân viên nòng cốt của công ty trong tương lai. Văn hóa công ty:Văn hóa YARUTOKI wα YARUTrong tiếng Nhật, cụm từ ""Yarutoki wa Yaru"" có nghĩa là làm việc một cách nghiêm túc khi đến lúc phải nghiêm túc, trong khi vẫn duy trì một không khí vui vẻ. Văn hóa của công ty chính là chúng ta vui vẻ khi làm việc nhưng đến lúc cần nghiêm túc thì chúng ta sẽ nghiêm túc và tạo ra những kết quả tuyệt vời.Tập trung vào giao tiếpChúng tôi thường xuyên tổ chức họp 1-1 với cấp lãnh đạo. Chúng tôi coi trọng giao tiếp không chỉ với đồng nghiệp mà còn với ban quản lý.Công ty là nơi mà chúng ta dành hầu hết thời gian, không chỉ để làm việc màcòn tận hưởng cuộc sống. Do đó, để xây dựng những mối quan hệ tốt đẹp ở công ty cho một cuộc sống tốt đẹp, chúng tôi luôn coi trọng việc “lắng nghe” trong giao tiếp.Kỷ luật và linh hoạt.Chúng tôi coi kỷ luật là sự chuyên nghiệp. Tuy nhiên, chúng tôi cũng rất coi trọng tính linh hoạt để ứng phó với những thay đổi. Cấp quản lý CEO｜Ito Takafumi Ông Ito là một CEO người Nhật Bản có kinh nghiệm dày dặn trong lĩnh vực Marketing ở trụ sở chính của tập đoàn Entetsu. Ông điều hành công ty IT gắn liền với quan điểm marketing cao cấp, điều này có nghĩa là bên cạnh việc hoàn thành sản phẩm, công ty còn đặc biệt quan tâm đến giá trị sử dụng của thành phẩm đó ngoài thị trường như thế nào. Công ty có thể cung cấp rất nhiều “kiến thức” cho các kỹ sư mong muốn biết làm cách nào mà những ứng dụng/ trang web của họ có ích đối với khách hàng và làm thế nào để tiến hành các dự án trong khi thấu hiểu các quan điểm, khía cạnh từ khách hàng. ",FULL_TIME,"Ổn định và tăng trưởng ~Chúng tôi là một công ty Nhật Bản lớn nhưng vẫn còn mới ở Việt Nam.
